  \begin{itemize}
    \item Improve performance of the transport when crossing low-quality links (high-loss, variable latency) or highly asymmetric links (narrow upstream bandwidth)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Examples: satellite, mobile netork, wireless
    \end{itemize}
    \item Put a PEP on one, sometimes both, end(s) of the weak link, let it split or spoof the TCP connection and perform a number of tricks, including:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item ACK manipulation (suppression, reconstruction, compaction)
      \item rwin size manipulation
      \item Header compression
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

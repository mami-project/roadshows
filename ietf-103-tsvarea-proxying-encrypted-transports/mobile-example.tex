  \frametitle{Mobile example}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Quite often, the mobile link ``freezes'' from the point of view of the transport while its data link protocols are busy retransmitting after a loss\footnote{This is not a congestive loss, it's just wireless physics.}
    \item The freeze may last longer than the typical RTT $\rightarrow$ sender thinks the path has lost its segment(s) $\rightarrow$ retransmits
    \item This is the clich\'e of a spurious retransmission: the loss has been repaired by the link layer in the meantime
    \item Here the PEP provides impedance matching at the point where wired and mobile links meet: it ACKs the sender in lieu of the UE, buffers the data and smooths it out to the UE when the link is back to normal
    \item Without the PEP, the sender would throttle (throughput \& goodput decrease)
  \end{itemize}

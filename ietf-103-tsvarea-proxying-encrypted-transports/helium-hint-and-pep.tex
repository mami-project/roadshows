  \begin{itemize}
    \item There seems to be a space that is worth exploring to understand what can be achieved with HiNT / Helium in this context, in particular:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Does it provide the right primitives?  If not, what is needed?
      \item Understanding the interaction between the tunnelled and the outer congestion controllers under diverse links and user mobility models
      \item In-band control channel, how can it be used?
    \end{itemize}

A throughput seeking flow that marks itself inconsistently is heavily penalised due to the increase in packet loss (basically, QCI 7's delay and packet drop budgets are not compatible with the dynamics of a bandwidth-hungry TCP flow). The aggregate throughput decreases, but because non-honest markers have no incentives, this is not a real problem

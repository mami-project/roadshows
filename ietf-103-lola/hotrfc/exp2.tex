\frametitle{Experiment two: the liar}

\begin{itemize}
\item one way real-time audio (64kbps)
\item two concurrent downloads on the UE, i.e. two TCP greedy sender (non application limited).
\end{itemize}
\vspace{.5cm}
Control and experimental groups are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item control (CTL): TCP flows are not marked (they go through the default bearer) while the real-time audio flow is marked as low-latency and routed through the low-latency dedicated bearer
\item experimental (EXP): TFT configured to route one of the TCP greedy flows (the liar) onto the low-latency dedicated bearer together with the real-time audio flow
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Experiment one: the honest marker}

Two concurrent applications on the UE resulting in two downlink flows:
\begin{itemize}
\item one way real-time audio (64kbps)
\item one download over TCP (greedy, non application limited)
\end{itemize}
\vspace{.5cm}
Control and experimental groups are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item control (CTL): no marking
\item experimental (EXP): LLT marking applied to the real-time traffic (i.e., honest marking)
\end{itemize}
